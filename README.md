<h1> Indicators </h1>

Parsing data from [http://www.siliconvalleyindicators.org](http://www.siliconvalleyindicators.org)

This project is an attempt to pandas pythonize the entire process of pulling and munging the data used by siliconvalleyindicators and then creating the numerous graphics within siliconvalleyindicators.org.  Then perhaps we can consolidate and enable research into this data in different ways.

<h2> Set up </h2>
You'll need python 3.6 for this application.  Check your python version with: 
python -V

The easiest way to get started is to install Anaconda.  This will setup the environment for you for development. 
Once you launch Anaconda, create a new environment for python 3.6.  Then, install jupyter to your environment.  Launch the jupyter and test your python scripts there.
